# CogMod-Tutorial

CogMod-Tutorial is a set of Python Jupyter Notebooks designed as an introduction to cognitive modeling in Human-Computer Interaction. It introduces students to Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning approaches to cognitive modeling.

Designed for delivery at CHI2022 and CHI2023 by Jussi Jokinen, Antti Oulasvirta and Andrew Howes.

Before starting the tutorial it is worth knowing a little about the Python programming language and also about Jupyter Notebooks. 

The notebooks for the tutorial will be made available in this GitHub repository on the day of the tutorial. 

If you are attending the tutorial then -- before this date -- you should read the contents of the file getting_started.ipynb.

If you click on getting_started.ipynb in the GitHub repository (above) then at the top of the document you will see a button that says "Open in Colab". Click on this button and read the document.
